some wings
garlic
ginger
rice wine
soy sauce
potato starch
franks hot sauce

combine garlic, ginger, rice wine, soy sauce and potato starch to make marinade.
marinade wings for a few hours but also set aside some marinade

deep fry wings at 180 celcius until about half cooked, then baste with more marinade and complete the fry

once fried, dip in franks hot sauce. I put that shit on everything.
